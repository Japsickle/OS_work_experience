1. Google what a Caesar Cipher is
2. Get input text from user, get key from user
3. Make an encrypt method that takes a key and the input text
- Hint: For adding key to each character look at converting characters to ascii values
4. Create a decrypt method
5. Create a Caesar Cipher class
6. Move encrypt and decrypt methods to the class
7. Initialise a new Caesar Cipher object in the main function
8. Use that object to call the encrypt/decrypt methods
9. Create a constructor in the Caesar Cipher class that takes the key and stores it in a property/field (google the diffrerence and have a think about what would be better)
10. Use that property/field in the methods instead of passing in the key as a parameter
